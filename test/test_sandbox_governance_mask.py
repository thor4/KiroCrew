"""The OS-level sandbox mask covers the crew data home's governance tree.

``security.sensitive_home_dirs()`` is the agent-TOOL gate: it is what
``is_sensitive_path`` refuses for a file_read/file_write tool call. The dir lists in
``sandbox.py`` are a separate, OS-level gate, and a spawned shell command reaches a path
fenced only by the first one. These tests pin the reconciliation between them:

* every crew-home entry on the tool gate has one of three sandbox dispositions,
* the ceilings are exposed READ-ONLY rather than hidden, in every mode,
* the deliberate read-write exceptions are exactly the declared set, in every mode.

The third is the one worth failing loudly: an entry that quietly moves from "masked" to
"exception" is a ceiling the agent can rewrite again.
